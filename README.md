# Super Mario World Engine in Python
This repository contains a 2D platforming engine, programmed in Python, that mimics the Super Mario World video game for SNES.
It supports jumping, running, enemy spawning, collision detection, and fireballs, among other features.

This engine was created as a college-level project and is only open-source as a demonstration, not as a ready-for-market game.
